ML VS TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING
Traditional programming = you code the logic.
Machine learning = the computer learns the logic from data.
1. In traditional programming, rules and logic are explicitly written by the programmer.
2. In machine learning, the computer learns patterns and rules automatically from data.
3. Traditional programming uses data + rules → output, while ML uses data + output → model (rules).
4 .Traditional methods work well for structured and predictable problems.
5. Machine learning is better for complex or data-driven problems like image recognition or spam detection.
6. Traditional programs give fixed and exact results, whereas ML gives probabilistic and adaptive predictions.
In short, traditional programming is manual rule-based, while machine learning is data-driven and self-learning.

  TYPES OF ML:
1. Supervised Learning:
Learns from labeled data (input–output pairs).
Uses: Spam detection, price prediction, sentiment analysis.
2. Unsupervised Learning:
Learns from unlabeled data to find patterns or groups.
Uses: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems.
3. Semi-Supervised Learning:
Uses both labeled and unlabeled data.
Uses: Medical image analysis, web content classification.
4. Reinforcement Learning:
Learns by trial and error using rewards or penalties.
Uses: Self-driving cars, robotics, game AI.
