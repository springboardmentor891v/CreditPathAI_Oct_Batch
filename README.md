📌 CreditPath AI – Predictive Modeling for Loan Default Risk & Personalized Recovery Strategy

📘 Project Overview
CreditPath AI is an AI-powered credit risk management system developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Internship 6.0.
The project focuses on predicting loan default risk and delivering personalized recovery strategies, enabling financial institutions to make faster, smarter, and data-driven lending decisions.

Loan defaults continue to challenge the financial sector, contributing to rising Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and significant monetary losses. Traditional recovery workflows are mostly manual, time-consuming, and non-personalized, making early detection of risky borrowers difficult.

To address this, CreditPath AI leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze borrower demographics, financial behavior, and repayment patterns. The system is designed to support:

Early identification of potential loan defaulters

Optimized and targeted recovery strategies

Stronger credit risk assessment

Data-driven decision-making

🛠️ Methodology
1. Data Collection

Gathered loan application records, repayment history, demographics, and behavior-based variables

Used financial institution datasets and publicly available financial data sources

2. Data Cleaning

Fixed missing data via imputation or removal

Standardized formats for uniformity

Treated outliers to reduce noise and improve model reliability

3. Feature Engineering

Created meaningful features such as:

Repayment ratio

Income-to-loan ratio

Late payment frequency

Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features for model compatibility

4. Model Training

Trained multiple ML models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and undersampling techniques

5. Evaluation

Measured model performance using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC

Used confusion matrix to assess defaulter identification accuracy

✨ Key Highlights

💡 Integrates both loan default prediction and personalized recovery recommendations

📊 Uses behavioral + demographic + financial profiling for deeper borrower insights

⚡ Built using scalable, open-source machine learning pipelines

🎯 Helps lenders reduce NPAs with early defaulter detection

🔍 Provides transparent feature insights for improved decision-making

🎯 Goal

To empower financial institutions with an intelligent, AI-driven risk management tool that enhances credit decisioning, reduces financial losses, and streamlines the borrower recovery process.
