# CreditPathAI_Oct_Batch
To design and develop a machine learning–driven platform that predicts borrower default risk and recommends personalized recovery actions. using open-source technologies to ensure cost-effectiveness, scalability, and reliability. The system aims to improve delinquency recovery efficiency and equip collection agents with actionable insights.

1. Goal
Predict loan default risk using ML on two datasets:
a.Loan Default Dataset
b.Microsoft Credit Risk Dataset

2. Datasets
Brief description of each dataset, features, target (Status, default etc.)
Mention basic stats, missing values, class distribution.

3. Algorithms (6 models)
Logistic Regression – linear model, baseline, interpretable coefficients
Decision Tree – tree splits, easy visualization, prone to overfitting
Random Forest – ensemble of trees, more stable, handles non-linearities
Naive Bayes – probabilistic, assumes feature independence
Linear SVM – finds separating hyperplane, works well in high dimensions
XGBoost – boosted trees, strong performance, uses regularization and early stopping

4. Evaluation
Describe train/test split (80/20, stratified)
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix
Show main results table (from final_comp)


   

Which model worked best on Loan Default?

Which worked best on Microsoft dataset?

Discuss trade-offs (accuracy vs. training time vs. interpretability).
