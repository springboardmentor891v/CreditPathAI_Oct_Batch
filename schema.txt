Schema

A schema acts as a blueprint or framework that outlines how data is arranged and connected. It specifies what kind of information is stored, how itâ€™s categorized, and how various elements relate to one another.
In simpler terms, a schema helps us understand the structure and logic behind a dataset, making it easier to locate and interpret information.

When creating a schema for a dataset:

Examine the dataset to find the main attributes (for example, name, ID, age, or cost).

Assign an appropriate data type to each attribute (like text, number, or date).

Identify links or relationships between datasets (e.g., matching customer IDs to their purchase records).

Review and validate the data to remove missing, duplicate, or inconsistent entries.

Data Profiling Tools

Data profiling tools are used to inspect and evaluate data quality, structure, and content. They help detect patterns, anomalies, and hidden relationships within datasets.
These tools play a vital role in data governance by ensuring that the information being used is reliable, consistent, and meaningful for analysis and business decisions.

Core capabilities include:

Structural assessment: understanding how data is organized and formatted.

Content evaluation: checking the validity, completeness, and accuracy of data values.

Relationship discovery: finding links or dependencies between different data fields or tables.
