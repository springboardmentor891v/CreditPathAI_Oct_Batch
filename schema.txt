Schema

A schema is a structured framework or blueprint that helps organize and interpret information.
It represents the way knowledge is stored and understood, allowing individuals or systems to 
recognize patterns and make sense of new data. In databases, a schema defines how data is 
organized, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints, ensuring data consistency 
and integrity. In psychology, schemas refer to mental structures that help people categorize 
and interpret experiences based on prior knowledge. Overall, a schema provides a foundation for 
understanding complex information efficiently, enabling both humans and machines to process, 
retrieve, and relate data in a meaningful way.

Schemas play a vital role in learning, decision-making, and problem-solving by allowing quick 
interpretation of new situations based on existing knowledge. They help reduce cognitive load
by organizing information into familiar patterns, making it easier to predict outcomes and 
respond appropriately. In computer science and data management, schemas also support efficient
data retrieval and communication between systems by maintaining a consistent structure. Whether 
in human cognition or digital systems, schemas act as guides that connect past experiences or 
data models with new information, improving understanding and efficiency.
