Schema: A schema is like a blueprint or plan that shows how things are organized. What kind of data is stored, and how different pieces connect. It helps you know where to find things. A schema is a plan that shows how things are arranged or organized. It helps make sense of complex stuff.

A schema is a structured plan that defines how data is organized â€” like naming columns, setting data types (e.g., number, text, date), and describing relationships between parts of the dataset.

To create a schema for a dataset:

1. Look at the data and identify key fields (like name, age, price).
2. Assign data types to each field (e.g., string, integer, boolean).
3. Define relationships if needed (e.g., linking customer ID to orders).
4. Check for missing or inconsistent values to clean and validate the schema.


Data profiling tools: analyze data to assess quality, structure, and content, identifying anomalies, inconsistencies, and relationships. 
these tools are important for data management, ensuring data accuracy, and enabling informed decision-making. 
Key functionalities:
