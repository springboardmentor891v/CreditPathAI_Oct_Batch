Correlation Heatmap:
A correlation heatmap is a graphical representation that visualizes the correlation coefficients between variables in a dataset using color intensity. Each cell in the matrix represents the relationship between two variables, with colors indicating strength and direction: red typically shows a positive correlation (variables move in the same direction), blue indicates a negative correlation (variables move in opposite directions), and color intensity represents how strong the relationship is. Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0s indicating no correlation.
