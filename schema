Schema:
A schema is a structured blueprint that outlines how data is organized, stored, and connected within a system. It defines each field (like name, age, price), its data type (text, number, date, etc.), and the relationships between different entities (for example, linking a customer to their orders). Schemas make complex data easier to understand, manage, and analyze.

Steps to create a schema:

1. Identify key fields: Examine the dataset to find important attributes such as names, IDs, or values.
2. Assign data types: Specify the format for each field — string, integer, boolean, date, etc.
3. Define relationships: Establish links between related tables or entities (e.g., customer ID → order records).
4. Validate and clean: Check for missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Data profiling tools:
Data profiling tools examine datasets to assess their quality, structure, and content. They uncover anomalies, inconsistencies, and hidden relationships within data. These tools play a key role in maintaining data integrity, improving database design, and supporting informed decision-making.

Main functions:

Structure analysis: Examines how data is organized (tables, columns, formats).
Content analysis: Reviews actual values to detect patterns, errors, or outliers.
Relationship discovery: Identifies links and dependencies between data elements or tables.
